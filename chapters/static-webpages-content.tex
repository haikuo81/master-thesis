\chapter{Static webpages content}

Deploying static resources the same way as before is no longer possible. We have to solve this problem with a different approach. There are at least 2 acceptable solutions. The first one is to upload static files to our CDN. Seznam.cz already has a custom CDN which is used for delivering images and other resources. But at the moment we are not using the CDN for delivering CSS and JavaScript files because there was no such need. Using this solution would mean to discard current debian packages for static resources and start uploading those files to the CDN instead. 

The second possible solution is to deploy static resources in a separate pod with their own nginx server which will be serving them. This solution seems as a little overkill to me because when a new version of CSS files will be created we will have to deploy new pods, wait until all running pods with static files are replaced and after that start deploying pods with new backend. The backend pods will also contain an nginx proxy because of SSL termination and security issues, so it seems unnecessary to run another nginx instance solely for the purpose of serving static files.
